		<string>Piqup</string>
		<key>shortDescription</key>
		<string>Piqup is a Dropbox client which makes it easy to take exclusive pictures and allows you to share them with your private group of choice.</string>
		<key>description</key>
        <string>Whether you are a journalist who has to deal with branded images day by day, or an individual who simply wants to take, upload and share a watermarked picture, Piqup is your ideal companion.
            
With Piqup you can:
    - Browse your entire Dropbox and view any image in there. Folders and images are cached, so Piqup doesn't unnecessarily waste your network bandwidth. Up- and downloads continue in the background.
    - Create folders inside your Dropbox and delete any file or directory in there.
    - Upload images to any folder in your Dropbox. Images can be taken by the camera, chosen from the library or used from the clipboard. A shareable link will be copied to your clipboard after the upload is finished, so you can instantly share the uploaded image.
    - Apply a watermark to your images. The Settings area allows you to select different watermark positions and change the watermark's transparency.
    - Set your desired output format (JPEG or PNG). Additionally you can define the compression rate of JPEG images.
    - Share your images to social services like Facebook and Twitter or send them via E-Mail, SMS or AirDrop by using a generated link or the image itself, which makes sharing extremely easy.
    - Recieve local notifications for background uploads.
    - Remove your Dropbox account or link to a different one at any time.
    - Switch between a light (default) and a dark mode.</string>

		<string>The TFO &quot;Max Valier&quot; is the most renowned high school focusing on technological subjects in my home province.</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>After my graduation from middle school, I had to decide which high school would be most appropriate to help me to accomplish my long term goals as a prospective computer scientist. That&apos;s why the TFO &quot;Max Valier&quot; in Bolzano - which is the most renowned high school focusing on technology in our province - was the way to go.
        
After two years of general studies, I focused on Information Technology in the next three years. Subjects like Informatics, Systems and Electronics greatly helped me in shaping my understanding of Computer Science and how it realates to other important fields. </string>

		<string>Birth and growing up</string>
		<key>shortDescription</key>
		<string>I was born on December 12th 1993 in the beautiful region of South Tyrol, Italy.</string>
		<key>description</key>
		<string>Even though I&apos;m an Italian citicen, I grew up as a German native speaker, because South Tyrol has once been part of Austria, but was a gift to Italy after World War I. Round about 70% of the population of South Tyrol speaks German as their first language, altough most of them prefer a quite aggressive dialect in their average day-to-day conversations.
            
Between 1999 and 2004, I attended elementary school in Soprabolzano. Then I went to the &quot;Franziskaner-Gymnasium&quot; (a private school in Bolzano) from 2004 to 2007. </string>
